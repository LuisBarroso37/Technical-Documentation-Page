# Technical Documentation Page
Technical Documentation Page Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made a technical documentation page for how to install Python in Windows.

Things I learnt:
- how to make a navigation sidebar
- how to use CSS grid

This page is built using plain HTML and CSS. 
In order to make the page responsive I have added Bootstrap in a later stage.
